# SheepquestEX-GrazeFuckKill
A Truly incredible Game

This is a game in which you play as a sheep and you kill enemies with bullets. You have a horny meter that goes up over time and a rage meter that goes up over time relative to that horny meter. The rage meter affects your stats and (currently unimplemented) when you reach the maximum rage you can graze which involves summoning a bunch of yummy forbs which give you stat boosts and resets your rage and horniness levels.
Overall the goal of this game is to combo kills together and get a high score. It's a fast paced FPS.
